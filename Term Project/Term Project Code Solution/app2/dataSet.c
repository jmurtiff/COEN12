/* This program is the implementation of the abstract data type   */
/* SET. For this application, we are using student records        */
/* contained within a structure with both an Age integer (from 18 */ 
/* to 30) and a unique ID integer (from 1 to 2000) within a       */ 
/* college. For this SET we will be conducting frequent search    */ 
/* operations and will care more about the efficiency in the      */ 
/* ability to locate specific student records given a student's   */ 
/* unique ID number. For this application we will be using hash   */ 
/* tables to more efficiently search for data in our SET. As with */ 
/* searching, hash tables are also used in the means of inserting */ 
/* and deleting elements from the SET. With an array of structure */
/* pointers pointing to student records, we will use a hash       */ 
/* function to more quickly find the elements we are looking for  */ 
/* within the SET itself. The structure that makes up a SET data  */ 
/* type contains two integer variables (count and length) that    */ 
/* hold the total number of possible student records (length) and */ 
/* the current number of student records (count) within the SET at*/
/* one time. The studentRecord double pointer points to the first */ 
/* student record pointer as part of our SET and is used within   */ 
/* our search student ID function to find matching ID numbers     */ 
/* between a student record and the given parameter within our    */
/* SET. Since we are using hash tables, we also have to implement */
/* an array of flags to check which spaces in our SET are empty   */ 
/* (not previously filled), removed (previously filled and then   */ 
/* deleted) and filled (currently containing an element). In      */ 
/* addition to our search function using hash tables, this program*/
/* can create a SET data type, destroy a SET data type, add a     */
/* student record into a SET, and remove a student record from a  */
/* SET.															  */ 

 
/* For hash tables an array of "flags" are used to mark which locations
 * within the SET data type are filled (with a student record pointer), removed
 * (previously deleted by the removeElement function), or empty (waiting to be filled
 * by the addElement function). These flags make it easier to tell which spots 
 * in our SET can have new elements inserted (removed or empty spots) and which spots
 * have student records that we need to look at (filled spots). These flags have
 * been defined in our program to represent "empty", "filled", and "removed" instead
 * of their character counterparts of "0", "1", and "2" to make the program easier to
 * read and understand the implementation of our hash table.
