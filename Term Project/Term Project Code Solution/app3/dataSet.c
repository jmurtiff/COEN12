/* This program is an implementation of the abstract data type    */
/* LIST. A LIST is an abstract data type in which operations (such*/
/* as retrievals, insertions, changes, and deletions) can be done */
/* anywhere in the list. This LIST abstract data type is being    */
/* used with the basic data type of linked lists. Linked lists    */
/* are dynamic data structures whose length can be increased or   */
/* decreased at run time. In the case of linked lists, the        */
/* searching algorithm that must be used is sequential search    */
/* (since you cannot directly access an element in the middle of  */
/* the linked list without first traversing through the elements  */
/* before (for singly linked list) or after (for double linked    */
/* lists). For the case of dataSet.c, we are using a circular     */
/* doubly linked list that is allowed to either traverse from the */ 
/* end (or tail end) to the beginning (or head) of the LIST or    */
/* from the beginning to the end. Since a linked list does contain*/
/* a space for data to be held, we are going to use structures    */
/* containing student records (both an integer ID and integer Age */
/* of a student who attends a college) to be held in a node in our*/
/* LIST. The structure that makes up our LIST abstract data type  */ 
/* type contains an integer variable (count) and a node pointer   */ 
/* "head" that will always point to the first node in our LIST    */ 
/* data type. Count will always tell us the current number of     */ 
/* elements within in our LIST data type and in the case of       */ 
/* dataSet.c, we are using a dummy (or sentinel) node that will   */ 
/* always act as our first node in our LIST (even if the LIST     */ 
/* itself does not have any other nodes). This dummy node limits  */ 
/* the number of special cases for the deletion/insertion of nodes*/
/* within our LIST. In essence, the dummy node makes our program  */ 
/* easier to implement and easier to understand for both the add  */
/* and remove function used in our implementation. In addition to */
/* the structure of our LIST abstract data type, there is also a  */ 
/* node structure that makes up each node within our linked list. */
/* Each node contains a data slot (which can hold a structure of a*/ 
/* student record and two node pointers that point to the previous*/
/* node in the linked list (prev) and the next node in the linked */ 
/* list (next). In addition to the function allowing the creation */ 
/* and deletion of LIST data types, dataSet.c can also search     */ 
/* through a given LIST by either age or ID of a student within   */ 
/* our LIST. Additionally, our implementation is able to add and  */ 
/* remove nodes (or student records) within our LIST as well as   */ 
/* return the maximum age gap between all students within a given */ 
/* LIST.														  */
